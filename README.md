 Udacity Free, online, self-paced courses in Android Development for Beginners: [Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud839)

The official [repository](https://github.com/udacity/ud839_Miwok) for the Udacity Miwok App.  
Refer to the branches for starter code, image assets, audio assets and final state (lesson five) of the app.  
Here's the [Miwok Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16sQ-0r5zMrdRXUwOaYbTLNXADasuSYFpy7K0Bn8oVfg/pub?embedded=true).

Eventhough the course is in Java, I attempt to code it in Kotlin.

## Installation
Start a new Android Studio project, copy and replace the app/src/main folder, then run it.
