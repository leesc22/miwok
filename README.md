 Udacity Free, online, self-paced courses in Android Development for Beginners: [Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud839)

The starter code [repository](https://github.com/udacity/ud839_Miwok/tree/Starter-code) for Miwok App

Eventhough the course is in Java, I attempt to code it in Kotlin.

## Installation
Start a new Android Studio project, copy and replace the app/src/main folder, then run it.
